An app that saves your location. Saves locations on a button push to a firebase database with sign in on firebase authentication. View your saved locations on a map. Currently, it is colors on a screen. I am using it as a project to learn React Native.

Setup:
1. Install Node
2. Add dependencies from the project: `npm install`
3. Install Expo for developing on other projects as well: `npm install -g expo-cli`
